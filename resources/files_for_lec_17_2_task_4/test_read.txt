Pancakes are some of the world’s most popular flour-based dishes. However every national cuisine has its own cooking traditions and secrets. Pancakes (bliny, blintsy, mliny) are cooked all over Belarus, on weekends and on holidays. There is one thing that differs Belarusian pancakes from pancakes cooked in other countries: Belarusians use all kinds of flour in pancake recipes.
Cooking Methods
Belarusian pancakesRye, wheat, barley, buckwheat, oatmeal or peas – all these cereals are used to prepare pancakes, either separately or in combination.
Usually pancakes are made from milk, kefir, or milk whey (sour pancakes). To make the dough puffy, one can use leavening agents (yeast) or raising agents (baking powder). Eggs and sugar are added to make pancakes sweet.
In ancient times pancakes were cooked in the oven on a frying pan greased with pork fat or a piece of lard. Today vegetable oil is commonly used for this purpose.
Accompanying Dishes

Associated Traditions
Maslenitsa in BelarusPancakes are not only some of the most loved everyday dishes in Belarus, but also an integral part folk rites and ancient customs.
Special sacral traditions are associated with pancakes in various regions of the country. Pancakes were a mandatory dish during the commemoration of the dead or ancestor worship.
In spring, when cattle were let out to pastures for the first time since winter, villagers used to give a shepherd a pancake for a cow herd to remain plentiful. These pancakes were meant for the spirits of the ancestors as well.
Girls used pancakes to tell their fortune at Yuletide. The girls who met their love would cook pancakes on the second day of the wedding and treat their guests.
On Shchedry Vecher (Generous Eve) on 13 January (the New Year's Eve in accordance with the Julian calendar, the so-called Old New Year) the head of the family, standing on the threshold of the house, would call on the Frost with a pancake in hand. Then a stack of 12 pancakes (by the number of months) was put on a festive table, cut crosswise into four parts, and all members of the family would take a piece. Thus "the year" disappeared from the plate as if in a spiral.
And, of course, pancakes is a must dish for Maslenitsa, the ancient Slavic celebration of bidding farewell to winter and welcoming spring. Round and golden pancakes symbolize the sun and therefore are cooked to please the god of spring, warmth and fertility Yarila.
Today this wonderful tradition lives on. During the Maslenitsa Week pancakes are cooked in every home and are offered at fun street festivals. In 2013 Belarus even set a kind of a pancake record.
